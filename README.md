# Comic-Book-Store-CSharp

As part of my BSC Computing (Hons) second year coursework for the Application Design module, we were tasked to create a C# desktop application that would simulate the running of a comic book store.

## Overview

The system supports two main user types: customers and staff, with management having extended administrative control. It uses an offline local system with dummy payment processing.

Key Features

    Customer Portal:

        Browse and search products including comics, action figures, DVDs, posters, board games, video games, and costumes.

        Create and manage accounts with avatars and personalized preferences.

        Place, edit, and review orders with a saved basket.

        Access order history and manage pickups.

        VIP customer program with reward points, special discounts, and exclusive offers.

        Delivery option with postage calculation for remote customers.

    Staff & Management Functions:

        Manage shop details, inventory, products, personnel, and customers.

        Track purchases, profits, wages, discounts, orders, and inventory status.

        Highlight low stock and item status changes (e.g., comics becoming back issues).

        Management-only access to sensitive data with secure and robust user authentication.

        Ability for managers to modify orders, inventory, and system settings.

    Marketing & Promotions:

        Display targeted ads and recommendations based on customer preferences.

        Announce new arrivals, events (e.g., ComicCons), themed party offers, and movie tickets.



A successful implementation of the project would have the following outcomes:

1.	Create entity relationship models reflecting the requirements of application domains.
2.	Develop and implement OO designs incorporating relevant inheritance, composition and interface relationships that reflect application requirements.
3.	Develop database designs with associated SQL to meet application data requirements.
4.	Compare and contrast different software development methodologies, designing and implementing an application within one specific such methodology.
